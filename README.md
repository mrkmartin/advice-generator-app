## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I gained knowledge in retrieving data using APIs and adding visual animations to button interactions.

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to continue focusing on
optimizing API interactions for performance. While I learned the basics of fetching data, I'd like to delve deeper into techniques like caching strategies, efficient data handling, and error management to create more robust and faster applications. I also want to become more comfortable with different API authentication methods and understand their security implications better.

### Useful resources

- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This resource was useful for addressing both styling and animation needs.
